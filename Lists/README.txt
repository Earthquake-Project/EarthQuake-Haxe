this code is only partially supported
it has extremely low priority as it implements functionality the base library may never use
everything here should run out of the box, and all the major bugs **should** be fixed
no promises, though

usage is simple, input valid lingo list text format and you should recieve the equivalent as JSON
basically, it's a data converter and is not strictly a part of the core earthquake library
it would be useful for modifying/porting/studying preference files, and possibly could be used in a [de]compiler with some tweaks
none the less, it is maintained in this repository as it would make no sense to split it into its own repository

please refrain from reporting issues for the time being as it is more important right now to read movies/casts, and that
is a lot of fairly difficult work!
