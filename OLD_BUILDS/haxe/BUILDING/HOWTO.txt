pre:
	Haxe 
	FlashDevelop
	It is useful to have a source code text editor like Notepad++

step one : 
	open ShockwaveParser.hxproj in FlashDevelop
	(I am using FD 5.2.0.3 - Brian151)
step two : 
	In the build configuration drop-downs,
	type one of:
		"RIFF","Earthquake","Application"
	(see buildconfig.png)
other stuff :
	If you add a new class, you will need to edit the module's 
	corresponding .hxml file to include it while compiling

	There is a particular process to building these as modules
	with an exposed API:
		RIFF & Earthquake:
		"@:expose" in the beginning of the .hx file
		RIFF:
			"#if (compileLvl=="libRIFF")
			@keep
			#end" after the expose statement
		Earthquake:
			"#if (compileLvl=="libShockwave")
			@keep
			#end" after the expose statement
		Application:
			no special statements
	excluding packages:
		Sometimes, modules will compile with dependancies included.
		To avoid compiling a package/Class, 
		use this in the .hxml file:
		--macro exclude("pkg1.pkg2")
		or
		--macro exclude("pkg1.pkg2.Class")
	hiding stuff from IDE's tree view:
		open ShockwaveParser.hxproj in code editor of choice
		find hiddenPaths node
		add:
			<hidden path="folderName" />
