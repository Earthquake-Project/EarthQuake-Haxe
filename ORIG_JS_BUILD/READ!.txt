currently not willing to upload the diropened spybotics binary
either make your own copy of that or find a new file... sry
don't want copyright strikes.
as-is, i have a delicate relationship with a few of the developers...

This version can now be considered obsolete
I will no longer support it, and it will be deleted
when I determine there's no code from it left to reference in the
Earthquake library...
